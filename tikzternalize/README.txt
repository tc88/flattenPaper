todo:

- be more flexible with the directory name where the figures are in and where they are generated by the externalizer
- if path as, e.g., ./figs/ is given as an argument to includegraphics, it does not work properly
- temf-bow.sty still needs to be flattened
- option for delete *.dep, *.dpth, *.log and *.md5 that are generated by the externalizer
